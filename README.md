# Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on customer details. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze financial history, credit scores, income, and loan details.

ðŸš€ **Project Summary**
Dataset: 45,000 records with 14 features
Target Variable: loan_status (1 = Approved, 0 = Rejected)

Techniques Used:
Feature Engineering: Standardization, correlation analysis, VIF check
Handling Imbalanced Data: Used SMOTE to balance loan_status
Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression (AUC: 96%) âœ…
Decision Tree (AUC: 86%)
Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting, Adaboost

**âœ¨ Key Insights**

âœ… Logistic Regression is the best model with 96% AUC after balancing data using SMOTE.  
âœ… Random Forest & Decision Tree are prone to overfitting (high train accuracy but lower test AUC).  
âœ… SMOTE improved model performance by balancing class distribution.
